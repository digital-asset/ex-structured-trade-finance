# Reference Application: Structured Trade Finance
## Introduction

The Structured Trade Finance application demonstrates a simplified example of creating a chain of participants between a Manufacturer and its Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 subcontractors. An External Auditor participant is created so Participants can request external certification for the supply chain (e.g. for Fairtrade, sustainability reporting, etc.). Subcontractors can request trade finance from a Bank with increased transparency because they can demonstrate their chain of partners and orders.    

## Getting Started

### Installing

**Disclaimer:** This reference application is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the DAML. You are recommended to consider other non-functional aspects, like security, resiliency, recoverability, etc prior to production use.

#### Prerequisites

Be sure you have the following installed:
- [DAML SDK](https://docs.daml.com/)
- Docker

#### Build

Type:
```shell
daml build
```

**Note:** If you change the DAML models locally, you need to re-run this command before starting the application.

### Starting the App

**Note:** Make sure you have built the application (see: [Build](#build)).

There are two options:

#### Option 1: Start App with Docker

1. Type:
    ```shell
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
2. Open UI with a browser at http://localhost:7500.

#### Option 2: Start App in Standalone

1. Start the DAML Sandbox and Navigator. Type:
    ```shell
    daml start --sandbox-option --address=localhost
    ```
    The navigator will automatically open in new browser tab at http://localhost:7500.

### Stopping the App

#### Stopping Dockerized Run
1. Stop the Docker containers by pressing **Ctrl+C**. (Alternatively, you can also stop it by typing `docker-compose down`.)

#### Stopping Standalone Run
1. Stop the Sandbox and the Navigator by pressing **Ctrl+C** in the DAML assistant.

### Resetting the Prototype

Reset the application by following these steps:
1.  Stop the app by following the steps in [Stopping the App](#stopping-the-app) section.
2.  Start the app in [Docker](#using-docker) or [Standalone](#standalone-mode) by following the steps in the relevant section.


## User Guide

This User Guide will take you step-by-step through the whole stuctured trade finance process of creating a simplified supply chain between participants, requesting a certification from an external auditor entity for the supply chain, creating orders between a manufacturer and its multiple tier subcontractors, and finally, a subcontractor asking for trade finance from a bank and being able to present an immutable audit trail of its order history.

After working through these steps, you can use the Navigator interface to explore other paths and options that are available in the application.

_**Note:** This demo is designed to show successful conclusion of the structured trade finance workflow without exceptions or error conditions. A full production implementation would include additional features, handle errors and exceptions, and incorporate appropriate security controls._

The Structured Trade Finance application includes the following steps:

1. **Market setup**: The application starts with an automated market set-up process. Participants and their roles are created, and relationships are set up.
2. **Onboard participants to supply-chain:** The Manufacturer onboards its Tier-1 Subcontractor to start the simplified supply-chain. Subcontractors invite their own Sub-contractors to create an end-to-end supply chain.
3. **Certify participant supply-chain:** Manufacturer can request an External Auditor to certify the participant supply-chain.  
4. **Create fulfillment request**: Manufacturer can request fulfillment for an order from the Tier-1 Subcontractor. Subcontractors can request fulfillment from their own subcontractors.
5. **Request trade finance**: Subcontractors can request trade finance from a Bank by presenting the original contract details and a verified, immutable upstream audit trail from the originating order. (E.g.: Tier-3 Subcontractor can request trade financing from Bank by presenting a given order coming from a Tier-2 Subcontractor, along with the trail of the given order all the way to the Tier-1 Subcontractor and the originating order from the Manufacturer).
6. **Approve loan request with amount**: Bank can review its loan requests, approve them, and specify amount for loan (full requested amount or less).
